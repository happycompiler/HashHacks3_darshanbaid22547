Our aim is to create a simple to use and accessible voice app that could help a person understand if she or he might have color blindness. The app uses Isihara Plates and Google Assistant's platform to ask end-user if he or she has Color Blindness. The app is available in English, Hindi (proposed) Portugese and French, making it available to a wide user base.
