Our aim is to create a simple to use and accessible voice app that could help a person understand if she or he might have color blindness.This app would help in checking colorblindneslss without the help of any doctor or inventory cutting costs to 0 and available anywhere/everywhere.In a country like india where doctor-patient ratio is very low this can be a huge success. The app would be available in English, Hindi and French, making it available to a wide user base.
